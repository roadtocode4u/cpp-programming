## Program Explanation:

**Line 1:** `#` is a path provider.<br> `include` is a directory/folder.<br> `<iostream>` is a class. <br>`<iostream>` stands for **Input Output Flow**.<br>
*ios is a combination of istream, streambuffer and ostream*

**Line 2:** `int`(number) means Return type of your Function. <br>`main()` it is a special function which is inbuilt.<br> It is triggers/involes automatically when program starts, it is the first function of every C++ program that is responsible for starting the execution and termination of the program.

**Line 2:** `{` is used to Start of the function.

**Line 3:** `std::cout<<"Hello world!";`<br> `std` stands for standard namespace. `::` is a scope operator.<br> `cout` stands for console out.<br> `<<` is a function used to output print text to the screen or to flash out it is also called Insertion operator or left shift.<br> The line `cout << "Hello world!";` causes the message "Hello World!" to be displayed on the screen.<br>**`;`** semicolon used to terminate any statement.

**Line 4:** `return 0;` return 0 means that the program will execute successfully.

**Line 5:** `}` closing curly bracket is used to end the main function.

**💻 Example 2 :**
```c

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    
    std::cout << "Hello World";
    
    std::cout << "\nHello ABC!";
